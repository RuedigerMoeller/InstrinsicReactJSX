Backs a blogpost (copied from kontraktor/examples).

These example are not updated (to keep them stable), refer to the original kontraktor github repo for newer / adapted versions.

The repo contains 3 maven projects:
* react-intrinsic-minimal. Minimal intrinsic react example (requires kontraktor-http only).
* react-no-babel. Sample App mentioned in Blogpost using kontraktor jsx transpilation and bundling.
* react-with-babel. Sample App mentioned in Blogpost using a nodejs babel/browserify daemon to perform jsx transpilation and bundling.
